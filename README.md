## Abstract
This project is based on the Nvidia open source example "jetson-reinforcement" developed by Dustin Franklin. The objective is to integrate a deep reinforcement agent with a robotic arm in a simulated Gazebo environment. By defining reward functions and deep learning parameters, the Deep RL agent incrementally learns the goal of moving towards an object to touch it.
